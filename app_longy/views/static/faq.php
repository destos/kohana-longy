		<dt>Why Longer?</dt>
		<dd>The url shrinkage epidemic has reached massive proportions and something must be done to counteract this. In an effort to cram urls into smaller and smaller boxes we have become shrunken ourselves, our ideas and future outlook have begun to follow as well. Who will dare stand up to the crowd? ( not me! )</dd>
		
		<dt>This is an amazing idea how can I help?</dt>
		<dd>Just keep on lengthning your urls! If you wish to contibute another way please <?= HTML::anchor( Route::get('app/static')->uri(array('page' => 'contact')), 'contact me')?>.</dd>
		
		<dt>What really can I use this for?</dt>
		<dd>Well in the future you might be able to use it to track different types of statistics related to your links, however currently that is either all hidden or non-functional. No touchy!</dd>
		<dd>In the meantime you can feel all fuzzy and warm inside knowing you are using the weird invention of someone who is possibly going insane.</dd>
		
		<dt>Will this website stay where it is?</dt>
		<dd>I'm not quite sure, currently this service doesn't have its own domain name and is hosted in my laboratory. If it does move I'll be sure to notify you via some big announcement of sorts.</dd>
		
		<dt>Seriously, longer urls?</dt>
		<dd>No, not seriously.</dd>
		
		<dt>Do I really have to make long urls?</dt>
		<dd>No, you can make hashes as short as 4 characters long by using the api. Why would you want to do that anways? >:| ( with the domain and directory it gets abit longer )</dd>
		
		<dt>Whats really going on here?</dt>
		<dd>I just wanted an excuse to learn Kohana 3 and thought this might be a good way.</dd>
